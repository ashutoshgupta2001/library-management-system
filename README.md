# library-management-system

Overview:
Create a backend with APIs using any SQL database for a library system. The system should allow a librarian (admin) to manage users and book requests, and library users to request and view book borrowing details. Code should be in Python language.

API Requirements:
    Librarian APIs:
    Create a new library user with an email and password.
    View all book borrow requests.
    Approve or deny a borrow request.
    View a userâ€™s book borrow history.
Library User APIs:
    Get list of books
    Submit a request to borrow a book for specific dates (date1 to date2).
    View personal book borrow history.

Note : Postman Api collection has been also present in the repository. Add it to your postman and perform APIs.
